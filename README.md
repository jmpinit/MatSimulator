Magnetic Actuator Table Simulator
=================================

Basic proof of concept simulator for the Magnetic Actuator Table (MAT). The MAT is a table with an array of computer-controlled electromagnets embedded in its surface. It uses the electromagnets to precisely move ferrous and magnetic objects across its surface.

Uses the [Slick2D game library](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) for graphics.
